Code
====

Start with downloading the latest release of the code from `DIRTY releases
<https://github.com/karllark/DIRTY_dustrt/releases>`_.
The latest development version can be obtained from the `github repository
<https://github.com/karllark/DIRTY_dustrt>`_
instead, but note that your mileage may vary with this version.

DIRTY uses the cfitsio library for FITS I/O.  This may already be
installed on your system, but maybe not.  It can be installed locally,
but make sure to update the `Makefile` appropriately so that the
cfitsio library can be found during compilation.

Run make in the DIRTY directory to generate the `dirty` executable.
