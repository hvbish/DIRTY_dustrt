DIRTY
-----

The DIRTY radiative tranfer/dust emission model for dusty astrophysical sources.
DIRTY stands for "DustI Radiative Transfer, Yeah!"
These pages specifically refer to DIRTYv2, the complete rewrite of
the original DIRTY code to be more robust, flexible, and spiffy.
DIRTY solves the radiative transfer problem in full 3D including
non-equilibrium and equilibrium thermal dust emission.

No support implied.  Support possible on a best effort basis.  Interesting
the developers in your science use has the most chance of success, but the
developers are busy with many other projects.
